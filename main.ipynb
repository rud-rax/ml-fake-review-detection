He was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very transparent with his \nanswers. We decided to get the Tikka Pizza, Southern Curry Chicken Bowl, and the Spicy Chcicken Kabob. We also ended with the Mango Lassi, Gulab Jamun and the Ras Maiai. The \nSouthern Curry Chicken bowl tasted great, but it came out a good 3-5 minutes before anything else so by the time we got the remaining food it was cold. The Tikka Pizza ________. \nThe spicy chicken kabob was good, but I wish it came out warmer and it wasn't very spicy. I enjoyed the salad that came with it and the garlic naan bread was amazing. The dessert \nwere unique. I can't say we were crazy about the Gulab Jamun but I did enjoy the Rad Maiai.\n\nThe atmosphere was open and inviting, and although not advertised (which isn't a bad thing always) they do have WiFi so as a student you can stop by for a quick lunch and do \nsome studying as well.\n\nOverall I was impressed. If you are looking for a quick food option that's different then traditional options this is a great place to consider!\n\nWarning: I wouldn't go in expecting authentic Indian cuisine but its good food so give it a try!",

         "The second location in Lubbock. Tikka Shack is a fast casual Indian cuisine with self-service similar to the Chipotle concept. In fact, the bowl it uses is very similar to the Chipotle \nbowl. The dining area is spacious with modern open ceiling. There are two private toilet rooms, one for each gender. The ordering process is simple and straightforward. The \nmenu selection is adequate, not overwhelming and easy to understand. The older lady that stationed at the front counter seems to be of Indian descent so it should hint at \nauthentic Indian cuisine. However, I wasn't impressed with my southern curry entree. It's slightly better than the supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal. The southern \ncurry misses the mark - it lacked flavors and depth. I had more enjoyable and better valued meals at Indian buffets I had visited. An example of Americanized Indian restaurant I \nlike is Tarka Indian Kitchen - it's fast casual dining without skimping in taste. I have known many ethnic restaurants and many more mediocre ones - the latter often have very \nmediocre chef who wouldn't make it his or her own hometown.",

So i have a pretty good idea what the food should taste like. Without sounding downright hateful, this must be what Indian prison food tastes like: it was watery, under seasoned, and made with the cheapest of ingredients. It had no spice which is the hallmark of indian food.and when i asked for chutney to try to spice up the food so it would be somewhat fit to eat, the establishment said: we don't have any but how about a chopped jalapeno pepper?\n\nI am sorry but the 4~ 5 star reviews are hoaxes. I will go as far as to say this: this was the worse food i have had to paid for in the last 10 years.",

However, this place has less spice and more flavor of the food. These guys have successfully modified the Indian dish into a Indian-American style of food. This will let a lot of people who cannot eat spicy food, get a taste of mouth-watering Indian dishes.",

The manager and the other girl were standing there seemingly only able to observe. We finally made our way up to the front and the manager asked the girl to have us wait 5 minutes before taking our order. 5 minutes turned to 10 and from what I gathered, they had run out of cooked chicken so they were waiting for more to be done. Ok, fine, but they could have said something instead of leaving us standing there. In the end, the food was not great. I ordered the Chicken 65 shack bowl (\"Chicken doused in spiced-up red-hot yogurt sauce, curry leaves, and green chilies\") however, it was not hot at all and lacked much flavor.
